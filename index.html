    <section><h1>About Time Talks</h1>
        
        <p>Time Talks is a series curated webinars given by professions working in the watch making and retail industry. Watch enthusiasts can watch & learn (pun unintended) from expert horlogists every month about the vast world of timepieces.

        From high end luxury Swiss time pieces to that first digital watch you got as a kid. Our experts cover all topics relative to time (pun intended)
        
        Each month we have a different "time talk" delivered by an expert in their chosen genre. From retailers, collectors, jewlers, designes and manufactures they will give you insight to help grow your knowledge and possible collections.</p>
