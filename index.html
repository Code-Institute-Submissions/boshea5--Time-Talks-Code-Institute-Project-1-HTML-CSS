        <h3> Time <i class="fal fa-watch"></i> Talks is a series of 3 webinars hosted by Professionals from the Irish Watch Industry</h3> 
        <h4>History</h4>
    
       <p>Watch enthusiasts can watch & learn (pun unintended) from expert horlogists every month about the vast world of timepieces.
       From high end luxury Swiss time pieces to that first digital watch you got as a kid. Our experts cover all topics relative to time (pun intended)
       Each month we have a different "time talk" delivered by an expert in their chosen genre. </p>
<br>
<h4> The Why ? </h4>
        
       <p>Over the last two years, there has been a massive investment surge in luxury timepieces. 
           Some watches that retailed for €8000 are now fetching over €20000 on the grey markets on sites like chrono24. 
           Time talks were created to guide potential buyers or those interested in the dos and don’ts of investing in luxury timepieces. </p>
<br>
<h4> What's in it for You ? </h4>
    
       <p>When buying something for yourself, the golden rule is to buy something you like. 
           There is no point in wearing a watch that you don’t find visually appealing just because it’s a good investment. 
           Time talks will guide you through finding a wearable investment that will hold its value and give you information on hidden costs like servicing.  </p>
