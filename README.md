# **_Time Talks_**

Time Talks is a website created for three Independent Jewellery stores who have collaborated on a series of 3 webinars hosted by Professionals from the Irish Watch Industry.

The aim of the site is to inform and increase the sales of high end wrist watches to new and existing customers as investments by offering free webinars to visitors who subscribe. 

The three retailers although collaborating on the project are also in competition with each other as well as being authorised dealers for competing brands. Thus the website needed to remain independent and as neutral as possible focusing on getting users to subscribe to the webinars.

## Wireframes

The wireframes for Time Talks were produced in [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com) The final site has some slight differences from the wireframe.

## Site Structure

Time Talks website has one page with 3 sections. The [Home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [About](about.html), [Our Experts](our-experts.html) and [Times-Dates-Subscribe](.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another 3 links in the 'About-us' section to direct the user to the store that are supporting the webinars

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts used were “Poller One” for the Logo and “Comfortaa” for the body text. The fall back was “sans-serif”

The typography was one of the most important styling components for the project. When researching other websites in the genre some of the most commonly used fonts were “Coldiac” , “Futura Thin” and “Myron”. These are used to project luxury and expense. Whereas Time Talks wanted to use a warmer typography to de-mystify the allure around luxury timepieces while also remaining classic , modern and legible.
  
![25361CE2-B335-4F2A-A30C-9362C42BA53B_4_5005_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148551729-7f7a6910-7b29-4d7e-a618-e78ee26cf80b.jpeg)
  
  The logo and H2 headers also incorporate a watch icon from font awesome. It is to reinforce that Time Talks is about wrist watches as opposed to clocks or other horological items. It is used in the 3 main sub-heading to reinforce design regularity and flow for the user. 
![9B655B7B-530E-4C6B-A04A-EC0326CA56DD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148551831-d03bbdd1-8dbb-47fc-895e-52268d237e01.jpeg)

 * ### Colour Scheme
     The Colour Scheme is based on the teal and brown Oyster Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona. The choice is reflected in the use of a similar faded background images used in each section and a brushed steel effect for the overall background. 

This colour combination is currently very popular in high end pieces and this particular model was one of the most googled watches in 2021.

The colours were used to created an inclusive and welcoming environment as opposed to the more deep classic and noir colours normally associated with luxury brands. Teal watch faces are also one of the most requested and searched for colours from younger buyers entering the luxury watch market.

# Features

Time Talks site is set up to be an informative C.T.A to drive subscribtions to its webinar. It is also easy to use with a clear intention. It contains regular navigation functions that most users will be aware of like the navigation bar and contact form. The overall feel of the website is intended to be warm and contrasting in style and feel to our partner stores websites to make sure the user knows they are on an independent site. 

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * Sited at the top of all the pages in the site, it is fully responsive and contains links to all the pages of the site to enable ease of navigation in one convenient location.
    * The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.

[Navigation bar image]![3DB6B561-7E81-44D3-B66D-9827033BAA81_4_5005_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148553335-d8937f42-ef83-4cfe-89eb-5cd196118316.jpeg)

  * ### About-Us
    The About Us section has a two fold intention. 

1.To let the user know what Time Talks is about, why it was formed and what benefits the visitor will gain if they subscribe to the webinar.

![CF12CC22-1908-41EE-A8B4-1532AE68271F_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148556934-a9ee5109-dd98-4c6c-897b-857d5e9a3f91.jpeg)

2.To inform the user of its partner stores and provide links to their websites.
![B6C42527-D62E-4F8F-BDD3-E8A2E454DB7F_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148571710-0be0ab98-394b-4587-bf8e-55082eec52c9.jpeg)

Within the “In Association With” content the site provides the user with links to direct them to their online-stores. 
The speakers are also employed by the retailers. This allows a nice flow of information into the next section as the user will have a previous introduction to their workplace - meaning that this content won’t need to be repeated in detail in their bio’s. 

[Back to top](<#contents>)

  * ### Our Experts

This section introduces our experts who will be giving the Time Talks and the topics which they will cover. 

It contains a profile image of each speaker to help personalise the experts. It  will hopefully help the user identify with the experts more than a branded image and convince them to subscribe to the webinar.
![28C559E5-FFB9-4D6F-9247-8AF7DC024943_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148570583-152b0d10-1c69-4f0b-9784-484fcfead34d.jpeg)

* ### Dates&Times/Subscribe
  
This section informs the user when the talks are taking place and a form field to subscribe.

The user will be sent a zoom/skype/goole hang-out link on the day of each talk.
  
  ![A84CFEE9-F318-4DBF-A7E4-1936E2152199_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148560242-35383f5c-c5fa-4ae6-a133-5da9e6d938f0.jpeg)


[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Footer
    
    * Contains social media links. To enhance the UX the links open in other tabs.
    * The social media presence will help the user contact Time Talks as opposed to the 3 retailers and will also encourage them to connect with Time Talks.
    
    
[Footer image]![C24E7FF2-A36F-49B0-A200-9B2C2EF60C20_4_5005_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148579285-c78e4cf9-a234-402d-bb00-bb12c538c977.jpeg)

[Back to top](<#contents>)



* ### Form Confirmation
* Once deatils are submitted it will redirect to home
   
## Future Features 

The site would like to integrate skype/zoom/google-hangout into the main body so that when the webinar is taking place it is framed within timetalks.ie

An mp3 or mp4 file will be installed in the "Our Experts" section to give a quick highlight of each speaker

The watch icons and hero image will have running time G.M.T

Youtube links will be provided to previous talks

A coupon code will be installed on the site for users to reference on the partners websites to economise the site with an agreed percentage amount off certain items

## Bugs

### Uresolved

![57E0849F-DBA9-48E0-9DA8-DEB57B49F997](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148692463-8fa3fa33-48c8-4181-b249-48c9911a56ec.jpeg)

This was a warning on the css code. On researching it the answer was that it wasnt a bug

![1F1AD7B2-D7BE-4E7E-87BE-DB296B76FBE5_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148692495-764aa727-4c2a-4d98-adfe-8627de5e0f88.jpeg)

### Google Chrome Crash Handler and Git Hub / Git Pod Issues

The project was constanly hamperd by overusing our data allowance. The issue has yet to be resolved. It seems to be becasue of the extension to use git hub on mac ios and Google Chrome Crash Handler constantly pulling data. It can be turned off. However it resulted in no gitpod button and loss of code. I had to revert to using Firefox as browser. Service Provider, Google and Slack could not provide an answer. Data was lost regulary due to our service been cut off.
