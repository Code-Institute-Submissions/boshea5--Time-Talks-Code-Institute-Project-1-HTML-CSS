# **_Time Talks_**

Time Talks is a website created for three Independent Jewellery stores who have collaborated on a series of 3 webinars hosted by Professionals from the Irish Watch Industry.

The aim of the site is to inform and increase the sales of high end wrist watches to new and existing customers as investments by offering free webinars to visitors who subscribe. 

The three retailers although collaborating on the project are also in competition with each other as well as being authorised dealers for competing brands. Thus the website needed to remain independent and as neutral as possible focusing on getting users to subscribe to the webinars.

## Wireframes

The wireframes for Time Talks were produced in [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com) The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Site Structure

Time Talks website has three pages. The [Home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [About](about.html), [Our Experts](our-experts.html) and [Times-Dates-Subscribe](.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another 3 links in the 'About-us' section to direct the user to the store that are supporting the webinars

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      The fonts used were “Poller One” for the Logo and “Comfortaa” for the body text. The fall back was “sans-serif”

The typography was one of the most important styling components for the project. When researching other websites in the genre some of the most commonly used fonts were “Coldiac” , “Futura Thin” and “Myron”. These are used to project luxury and expense. Whereas Time Talks wanted to use a warmer typography to de-mystify the allure around luxury timepieces while also remaining classic , modern and legible.
  
![25361CE2-B335-4F2A-A30C-9362C42BA53B_4_5005_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148551729-7f7a6910-7b29-4d7e-a618-e78ee26cf80b.jpeg)
  
  The logo and H2 headers also incorporate a watch icon from font awesome. It is to reinforce that Time Talks is about wrist watches as opposed to clocks or other horological items. It is used in the 3 main sub-heading to reinforce design regularity and flow for the user.

 * ### Colour Scheme
     The Colour Scheme is based on the teal and brown Oyster Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona. The choice is reflected in the use of a similar faded background image in the “Our Expert” section. 

This colour combination is currently very popular in high end pieces and this particular model was one of the most googled watches in 2021.

The colours were used to created an inclusive and welcoming environment as opposed to the more deep classic and noir colours normally associated with luxury brands. Teal watch faces are also one of the most requested and searched for colours from younger buyers entering the luxury watch market.

# Features

Time Talks site is set up to be an informative C.T.A to drive subscribtions to its webinar. It is also easy to use with a clear intention. It contains regular navigation functions that most users will be aware of the navigation bar and contact form. The overall feel of the website is intended to be warm and contrasting in style and feel to our partner stores websites. 

## Existing Features  
  * ### Navigation Menu

    * Sited at the top of all the pages in the site, it is fully responsive and contains links to all the pages of the site to enable ease of navigation in one convenient location.
    * The logo is clickable with a link back to the home page for enhanced UX.

  * ### About-Us
    The About Us section has a two fold intention. 

1.To let the user know what Time Talks is about, why it was formed and what benefits the visitor will gain if they subscribe to the webinar.
2.To inform the user of its partner stores and provide links to their websites.

The Section also houses the “In Association With” content and provides the user with hyperlinks to direct them to their online-stores. 

The speakers are also employed by the retailers. This allows a nice flow of information into the next section as the user will have a previous introduction to their workplace meaning this content won’t need to be repeated in detail in their bio’s. 

![CF12CC22-1908-41EE-A8B4-1532AE68271F_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96124619/148556934-a9ee5109-dd98-4c6c-897b-857d5e9a3f91.jpeg)

  * ### Our Experts

This section introduces our experts who will be giving the Time Talks and the topics which they will cover. 

It contains a profile image of each speaker to help personalise the experts. It  will hopefully help the user identify with the experts more than a branded image and convince them to subscribe to the webinar.

* ### Dates&Times/Subscribe
  
This section informs the user when the talks are taking place and a form field to subscribe.

The user will be sent a zoom/skype/goole hang-out link on the day of each talk.

[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Footer
    
    * Contains social media links. To enhance the UX the links open in other tabs.
    * The social media presence will help the user contact Time Talks as opposed to the 3 retailers and will also encourage them to connect with Wawas Woods.
    * To help the user with navigation on all devices a 'scroll to the top' arrow was added. It sticks to the bottom left of the screen at all times to give the user a quick and unobstructed way to the navigation bar. The arrow is semi-transparent with a light/dark contrasting border for use against all background colours.
    * The GitHub and LinkedIn social links are there for the educational side of this project. They would be removed if this site was deployed outside of this project.

* ### Projects

    * The projects page give the user an idea of the recent projects that have been worked on. It also shows a number of different wood working techniques and finishes to help inspire the user's design.
    * There are images of the recent projects. To help enhance the UX two slideshows have been added to allow the user to see more images of two of the pieces.
    * This section would be updated periodically to reflect new recently finished projects.

![Projects page image](assets/readme-images/projects4.png)
[Back to top](<#contents>)

* ### Inspiration
    * The inspiration page is mainly there to demonstrate how a project starts and what is required to transform it into a finished project. It should inspire the user with the images of unfinished wood and get the user to imagine how that would look as a finished product.
    * It also contains a brief description of how the project would be constructed to give the user a rough idea of what goes on behind the scenes.
